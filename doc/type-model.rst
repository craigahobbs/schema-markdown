Type Model
==========

At the heart of Schema Markdown is the **type model**. The type model is a dictionary object that
maps schema type names to schema type definitions. The type model's documentation is available here:

`The Schema Markdown Type Model <https://craigahobbs.github.io/schema-markdown-doc/doc/#var.vName='Types'>`__

If needed, the compiled type model can be imported as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from schema_markdown import TYPE_MODEL
